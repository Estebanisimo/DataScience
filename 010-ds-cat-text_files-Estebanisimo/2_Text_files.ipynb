Crea un fitxer de sortida al directori de treball actual anomenat `blkpms.txt`, que té el mateix contingut que `blakepoems.txt`, excepte que s'eliminen totes les vocals (insensible a majúscules i minúscules). Al final, mostra quants caràcters has llegit i quants caràcters has escrit. Si voleu comprovar el contingut de `blkpms.txt`, podeu obrir-lo en un editor de text o mostrar les primeres 10 línies més o menys al final del vostre programa."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":39,"metadata":{"id":"gH15kpuAELK0"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Characters read: 37870\n","Characters written: 27722\n"]}],"source":["# Removing vowels.\n","\n","from os.path import join\n","\n","def removevowels( line ):\n","  newline = \"\"\n","  for c in line:\n","    if c not in \"aeiouAEIOU\":\n","      newline += c\n","  return newline\n","\n","inputname = join( CURR_DIR, \"blakepoems.txt\" )\n","outputname = join( CURR_DIR, \"blkpms.txt\" )\n","\n","fpi = open( inputname )\n","fpo = open( outputname , \"w\" )\n","\n","countread = 0\n","countwritten = 0\n","\n","while True:\n","  line = fpi.readline()\n","  if line == \"\":\n","    break\n","  countread += len( line )\n","  line = removevowels( line )\n","  fpo.write( line )\n","  countwritten += len( line )\n","\n","fpo.close()\n","fpi.close()\n","\n","print( \"Characters read:\", countread )\n","print( \"Characters written:\", countwritten )"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ubZWW0zpELK0"},"source":["---"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"collapsed_sections":[],"name":"TODO_Text Files.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.0"},"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"b02646c2acf2880c24eece31917d6bae663a5484fc466adbcfd30a4b011917d2"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
